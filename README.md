# Handwritten Digit Recognition Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a handwritten digit recognition model trained using TensorFlow and Keras on the MNIST dataset.

## Description

The handwritten digit recognition model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify images of handwritten digits into their respective numerical values (0-9). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.

## Features

- **Training the Model**: Users can train the model using the MNIST training dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as the number of epochs and batch size.
- **Evaluating Model Accuracy**: After training, users can evaluate the model's accuracy on the MNIST test dataset to assess its performance on unseen data.
- **Making Predictions**: Users can upload their own handwritten digit images or use images from the MNIST test dataset to make predictions using the trained model.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/harshala334/Handwritten-digit-recognition.git`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies (Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Jupyter Notebook) using `pip install tensorflow keras jupyter`.
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Navigate to the cloned repository directory and run `jupyter notebook handwritten_digit_recognition.ipynb`.
4. **Interact with the Model**: Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model, evaluate its accuracy, and make predictions on handwritten digit images.
